# Roam N Route 

##Overview
The **Roam N Route** is an application will provide college students with a way to find places to study, do work, 
or meet with friends around the city with a focus on places that do not require spending money. 
Our program will include a main feed, a search feature, and the ability for users to add and review locations. 
The main feed will show users pictures and information about locations that are similar to other locations the user has searched for or saved.
This will be a way for users to find places that they otherwise might not have heard of. We were inspired by the functionality of Tinder, 
where users will be shown a location and they can swipe left or right to show interest in going to this place, If user swipes right they will get the option to schedule an exact date and time where they want to go to the place, and they could be matched with someone going at the same exact time, helping college students make friends outside college atmosphere, and they could either deny or accept that match.. The search feature will allow users to look for 
specific locations based on area, price, or keywords. The ability for users to add locations and reviews, notes, and pictures to existing 
locations will mean the program is constantly growing and will have a “word of mouth” experience.
